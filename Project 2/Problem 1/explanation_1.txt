Least Recently Used Cache
--------------------------------------

Explanation:
Data Structure: OrderedDict(Dictionary) 
The advantage of using OrderedDict is that it maintains the order in which values are inserted based on the key.

get Function: In this function first I pop the value based on the passed key which returns the value of the corresponding key.
then I insert that value back to the dictionary and return value for that key.

set Function:
1.here, first I check whether the capacity is 0,if it is 0 then I cannot add the value.
2.Then I check whether the key is already present if the check is alredy present then I just replace the value
3.If the key is not present and if the cache is not full then I just push the key value pair but if the cache is full I just remove the first element which I have added before and I add the new pair.

Time Complexity:O(1)
Since, I have used python dictionary the lookup time is O(1).

Space Complexity:O(n)
since, the cache can hold element upto capacity that is mentioned.
