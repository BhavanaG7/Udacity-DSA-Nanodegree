File Recursion
--------------------------------------

Explanation:
At first we check for the suffix if it is empty string we return empty list.
then we make a recursive call based on visit to each folder, if the file with suffix specified is not found then we go deeper through each level of the folder.
and I have also used for loop to check whether it is file or folder.

Time Complexity:O(n*d)
----------------
where,n-number of directories
      d-depth of directory.
based on the iteration that is performed.

Space Complexity:O(r)
-----------------
r-number of returns from the function.
since, the space complexity depends on the number of returns from function.
