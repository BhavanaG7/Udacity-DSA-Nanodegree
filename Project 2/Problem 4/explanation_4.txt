Active Directory
--------------------------------------

Explanation:
In this program,first we check if the user is in group if so we True else we return False.
then we make the recurssive call for the function.

Time Complexity:O(g*u)
---------------
where, g-number of groups
       u-number of users
since,time complexity depends on the number of groups and also number of users.

Space Complexity:O(r)
----------------
r-number of returns the function
since it depends on the number of returns from the recurssive call of the function.
