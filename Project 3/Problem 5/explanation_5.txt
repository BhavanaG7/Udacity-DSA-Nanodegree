Autocomplete with Trie:
----------------------

In this problem we develop the trie data structure derived from a tree.

Time complexity:O(A*N)
For Searching and Inserting in the trie depends on the length of the word 'A' thatâ€™s being searched
and also the number of total words, n, making the runtime of these operations O(a*n). 

Space complexity:O(N)
In worst case, when we have a word (or words), with no common characters between them.
