HTTPRouter using a Trie:
-----------------------

Explanation:
This problem is similar to problem 5 with some difference.
first we should clean the path by removing occurencesof / with strip and then spit them into list. 

Time Complexity:O(n)
since,we iterate through the list. 

Space Complexity: O(n) 
A new TrieNode is created for each part of the path

For Lookup Method
Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(1)
No additional memory is allocated
