Finding the Square Root of an Integer:
--------------------------------------

Explanation:
This problem can be solved by using binary search appoarch.
In this problem i have used two pointers using which i can find the middle value and reduce the number of iterations everytime.

Time Complexity:O(log(n))
->Since, binary search halves the input set in each iteration.

Space Complexity:O(1)
-> since, the algorithm doesn't take any extra space it has constant Complexity.
