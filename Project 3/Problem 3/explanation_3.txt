Rearrange Array Elements
------------------------

Explanation:
after observation we can identify that the output is in the form of alternative numbers after the array is sorted in descending order

so the steps that we can use to solve this problem is to use heap sort to sort the Elements and pop the elements from the max heap.

Time Complexity:O(NLogN)
Heapifying the array takes O(nlog n).
Pop operation takes O(log n)and creating the output takes O(n) resulting in O(nlog n).

Space Complexity: O(n)
The max heap creates a new array of size n.
